# Simple Portfolio

This is a very simple portfolio demo.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — tiny JS for year, smooth scroll and demo contact handler

Projects included:
- Agro Connect — weather forecasting site (API integration, data visualization)
- Stampede Prevention — crowd safety system (real-time processing, IoT/AI)

To view locally:

```powershell
# from the workspace folder
cd "d:\Mern intern\portfolio"
# open in default browser (Windows)
start .\index.html
```

This is a static demo; contact form does not send messages (demo only).

Add your photo
----------------

Place a square photo named `avatar.jpg` in the project folder `d:\Mern intern\portfolio`. Recommended size: 400x400px (the site will crop to a circle). If you use a different filename, update the `src` in `index.html` for the `img#profilePhoto` element.

If the image is missing, the site will show your initials as a fallback.
